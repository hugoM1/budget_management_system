# Budget Management System - Project Summary

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive Django + Celery Budget Management System for an Ad Agency. The system tracks daily and monthly advertising budgets, automatically manages campaign activation/deactivation based on budget limits, and enforces dayparting schedules.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Data Models
- **Brand**: Represents advertising clients with daily and monthly budget limits
- **Campaign**: Belongs to brands, tracks status (active/inactive/paused), and manages budgets
- **Spend**: Tracks daily and monthly spend for campaigns with automatic reset capabilities
- **DaypartingSchedule**: Defines when campaigns can run with time-based restrictions

### 2. Core Business Logic
- **Spend Tracking**: Automatic tracking of campaign spend with real-time updates
- **Budget Enforcement**: Automatic campaign pausing when daily/monthly limits are exceeded
- **Dayparting**: Time-based campaign activation based on configured schedules
- **Budget Resets**: Daily and monthly automatic budget resets with campaign reactivation

### 3. Celery Integration
- **Periodic Tasks**: Every-minute budget checks and spend simulation
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Daily (00:00 UTC) and monthly (1st of month) resets
- **Background Processing**: Asynchronous task execution for all budget operations

### 4. Django Admin Interface
- **Comprehensive Admin**: Full CRUD operations for all models
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live budget utilization and campaign status tracking
- **Admin Actions**: Bulk campaign activation/pause and budget reset capabilities
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded budget utilization and status displays

### 5. Type Safety
- **Full Type Hints**: All functions, methods, and classes have proper type annotations
- **MyPy Configuration**: Comprehensive static type checking setup
- **Django Stubs**: Proper typing support for Django models and admin

### Data Flow
1. **Campaign Creation**: Brands and campaigns are created via Django admin
2. **Spend Tracking**: Real-time spend updates via Celery tasks
3. **Budget Enforcement**: Automatic checks every minute via periodic tasks
4. **Dayparting**: Time-based activation based on configured schedules
5. **Resets**: Daily/monthly automatic budget resets

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Redis server
- PostgreSQL (primary database)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd budget_management_system
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Database setup
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start Redis (required for Celery)
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Start Celery worker
celery -A budget_system worker --loglevel=info

# Start Celery beat (in another terminal)
celery -A budget_system beat --loglevel=info

# Start Django server
python manage.py runserver
```

### Testing the System
```bash
# Run the test script
python test_system.py

# Test Celery tasks (requires Redis)
python test_celery.py

# Run type checking
mypy .
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

### Celery Schedule
- **Budget Checks**: Every 60 seconds
- **Daily Reset**: 00:00 UTC daily
- **Monthly Reset**: 1st of month at 00:00 UTC

## 📈 System Workflow

### Daily Operations
1. **00:00 UTC**: Daily budget reset, reactivate eligible campaigns
2. **Every minute**: Check active campaigns for budget compliance
3. **Real-time**: Track spend and enforce dayparting schedules

### Monthly Operations
1. **1st of month, 00:00 UTC**: Monthly budget reset
2. **Campaign reactivation**: Resume campaigns paused due to monthly limits

### Real-time Operations
1. **Spend tracking**: Continuous monitoring of campaign spend
2. **Budget enforcement**: Automatic pausing when limits exceeded
3. **Dayparting**: Time-based activation/deactivation
4. **Status updates**: Logging and monitoring of all changes

## 🎯 Assumptions and Simplifications

1. **Timezone**: All times stored in UTC for consistency
2. **Spend Simulation**: Spend is simulated rather than from real ad serving data
3. **Budget Granularity**: Budgets tracked at campaign level
4. **Dayparting**: Simple time window approach (extensible to complex schedules)
5. **Database**: PostgreSQL for production-ready development
